1. download the demo.tar.gz file from
www.cse.ucsd.edu/~hshan/demo.tar.gz

2. unzip the demo to a local directory DIR

3. start matlab, and change current director to DIR

4. try run_preprocess to see how PCA works

5. try run_slider to see how changing PC values will change the face 
representation;

6. try run_synthesize to see how a new face can be generated based on two 
existing faces;

7. try run_perceptron to see how a perceptron learns to classify sample 
points belonging to two classes;

8. try run_backprop to train the network for identity, gender or 
expression recognition (you need to run_preprocess first, and save your 
projected values.  Or you can use the preprocessed CAFE_40, POFA_30, or 
POFA_50.  POFA stands for the dataset, and 50 is the number of PC's 
preserved.).

9.  I am not sure whether you can use test.m to test the network 
performance.  But I guess so.

Good luck!
